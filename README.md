# QuizEase
My Final Year Project. A MABT (Mobile App Based Test) System
This is an android mobile application software written in Java Programming Language.
It is a quiz app system for academic institutions which features student registration, course registration, contact teacher option and quiz writing.
The quiz feature allows only for user to write pre registered courses. The registerered courses are saved in both the cloud databasem(firebase) and local database of the user account.
The quiz interface initializes an ML feature which monitors eye and face movement to prevent malpractice. 
If the eyes or face of the user is not found, the quiz is automatically submitted.
If the user minimizes the app, the quiz automatically submits.
The app is not yet polishe and thus is still under development.

If you desire or have interset in the project, as a fellow developer or sponsor or just a tech enthusiast like me, contact me via equality560@gmail.com
